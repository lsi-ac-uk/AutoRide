## üñºÔ∏è UML Diagrams

### Use Case Diagram
A Use Case Diagram is a visual representation in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that illustrate the various
interaction between users (actors) and a system. It provides a high-level view of the functionalities a system 
offers and the actors involved in using those functionalities.

#### AutoRide Use Case Diagram
The Use Case Diagram for the AutoRide Online Cab Sharing Platform illustrates the interactions 
between three key actors: The customer, the Self-Driving Car, and the Platform.

* Customer: Represents the end-user of the platform who initiates ride requests. The customer
  interacts with the system through actions such as logging into the app, selecting their origin
  and destination, and sending a ride request.
* Self-Driving Car: Represent the autonomous vehicles within the platform's fleet. The self-driving car
  interacts with the system by performing actions like contacting the passenger to confirm the ride, starting
  and ending the trip, and handling payment processing.
* Platform: Serves as the central intelligence of the cab-sharing ecosystem. It's responsible for analyzing ride requests,
  dispatching orders to available cars, and managing the allocation of cars to specific rides.

### Class Diagram
A class Diagram is a visual representation in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that provides a structural view of
a system. it depicts the classes, their attributes, methods, and the relationships between them.

In a Class Diagram:
* Classes: Represent the objects or entities in the system. They encapsulate data (attributes)
  and behavior (methods) related to those entities.
* Attributes: Describe the properties or characteristics of a class. They define what data a class holds.
* Methods: Specify the actions or behaviors that a class can perform. They define the operations
  that can be applied to the class.
* Relationships: Illustrate how classes are connected or related to one another. These
  relationships include associations, dependencies, inheritances, and more.

Class Diagrams are invaluable for modeling the structure of a system, providing a blueprint
for developers to understand the relationships and responsibilities of different classes.
They serve as a communication tool for stakeholders to visualize the system's architecture, 
aiding in system design and development.

#### AutoRide Use Class Diagram
This project represents an application for managing customer data, trips,
payments, vehicles, and locations in a cab-sharing service.

- **Customer**: Represents a customer with attributes like ID, name, gender, and contact information.
- **Location**: Contains information about a specific geographical location, including its latitude and longitude.
- **Payment**: Manages payment details including amount, method, and status. Each payment is associated with a specific customer.
- **Trip**: Represents a trip made by a customer using a vehicle. It includes start and end locations, trip status, and associated payment information.
- **Vehicle**: Contains information about the Autonomous car such as status, last service, and last location.
- **VehicleBasicInformation**: Contains details about vehicles such as manufacturer, name, and type.

- **Enums**:
    - **Genders**: Represent the gender of a customer (Male, Female, Unknown).
    - **PaymentMethods**: Indicates the method used for payment (Cash, Credit, Online)
    - **PaymentStatus**: Describes the status of a payment (Successful, Unsuccessful, Cance, InProgress).
    - **TripStatus**: Represent the status of a trip (Started, Done, Canceled).
    - **VehicleStatus**: Indicates the status of a vehicle (UnderRepair, Vacant, Full, OutOfOrder)
    - **VehicleTypes**: Specifies the type of vehicles (Sedan, SUV, CrossOver, Hatchback, Minivan, Van)
 
This class diagram serves as a visual guide for understanding the relationships between the various components of the AutoCar application.
For a detailed explanation of each class and their respective properties and methods, refer to the code files in the repository.
