## üåü Introduction

### Welcome to the AutoRide repository!

Since the 17th of Centuries, the legacy of transportation services has woven its way through history, 
connecting eras of innovation and convenience. Today, we proudly introduce Sutton AutoRide, a distinguished 
online taxi company at the intersection of time-honored tradition and cutting-edge technology. 
Just as horse-drawn carriages once traversed bustling streets in 17th-century Europe, we embark 
on a journey that harmonizes the past with the future.
Our roots trace back to when merchants, innkeepers, and elitists harnessed the power of taxis for 
their travels. The 17th-century hackney carriages of London set the stage, offering rides to 
pedestrians in densely populated areas. This early concept paved the way for the evolution of transportation, 
with regulations and licensing gradually shaping the landscape. From the introduction of the hansom cab in 1834, 
which revolutionized the speed and efficiency of city travel, to the present day, where artificial 
intelligence and self-driving cars are on the horizon, Sutton Auto Wheels has embraced each era's advancements.

With a history spanning centuries, we are not simply a taxi company but a testament to the resilience 
of an idea that has adapted and thrived. As we step into the future, we carry this legacy forward, 
leveraging state-of-the-art technology to enhance the riding experience for our passengers. Our commitment 
to excellence, safety, and efficiency remains unwavering as we strive to seamlessly blend the timeless 
elegance of the past with the limitless possibilities of the future. Welcome to Sutton AutoRide, where 
tradition meets innovation on the road ahead.
Now, we are proud to announce that we are the first company to use self-driving cars using artificial intelligence technology.

## üñºÔ∏è UML Diagrams

### Use Case Diagram
A Use Case Diagram is a visual representation in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that illustrate the various
interaction between users (actors) and a system. It provides a high-level view of the functionalities a system 
offers and the actors involved in using those functionalities.

#### AutoRide Use Case Diagram
The Use Case Diagram for the AutoRide Online Cab Sharing Platform illustrates the interactions 
between three key actors: The customer, the Self-Driving Car, and the Platform.

* Customer: Represents the end-user of the platform who initiates ride requests. The customer
  interacts with the system through actions such as logging into the app, selecting their origin
  and destination, and sending a ride request.
* Self-Driving Car: Represent the autonomous vehicles within the platform's fleet. The self-driving car
  interacts with the system by performing actions like contacting the passenger to confirm the ride, starting
  and ending the trip, and handling payment processing.
* Platform: Serves as the central intelligence of the cab-sharing ecosystem. It's responsible for analyzing ride requests,
  dispatching orders to available cars, and managing the allocation of cars to specific rides.

### Class Diagram
A class Diagram is a visual representation in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that provides a structural view of
a system. it depicts the classes, their attributes, methods, and the relationships between them.

In a Class Diagram:
* Classes: Represent the objects or entities in the system. They encapsulate data (attributes)
  and behavior (methods) related to those entities.
* Attributes: Describe the properties or characteristics of a class. They define what data a class holds.
* Methods: Specify the actions or behaviors that a class can perform. They define the operations
  that can be applied to the class.
* Relationships: Illustrate how classes are connected or related to one another. These
  relationships include associations, dependencies, inheritances, and more.

Class Diagrams are invaluable for modeling the structure of a system, providing a blueprint
for developers to understand the relationships and responsibilities of different classes.
They serve as a communication tool for stakeholders to visualize the system's architecture, 
aiding in system design and development.

#### AutoRide Use Class Diagram
This project represents an application for managing customer data, trips,
payments, vehicles, and locations in a cab-sharing service.

- **Customer**: Represents a customer with attributes like ID, name, gender, and contact information.
- **Location**: Contains information about a specific geographical location, including its latitude and longitude.
- **Payment**: Manages payment details including amount, method, and status. Each payment is associated with a specific customer.
- **Trip**: Represents a trip made by a customer using a vehicle. It includes start and end locations, trip status, and associated payment information.
- **Vehicle**: Contains information about the Autonomous car such as status, last service, and last location.
- **VehicleBasicInformation**: Contains details about vehicles such as manufacturer, name, and type.

- **Enums**:
    - **Genders**: Represent the gender of a customer (Male, Female, Unknown).
    - **PaymentMethods**: Indicates the method used for payment (Cash, Credit, Online)
    - **PaymentStatus**: Describes the status of a payment (Successful, Unsuccessful, Cance, InProgress).
    - **TripStatus**: Represent the status of a trip (Started, Done, Canceled).
    - **VehicleStatus**: Indicates the status of a vehicle (UnderRepair, Vacant, Full, OutOfOrder)
    - **VehicleTypes**: Specifies the type of vehicles (Sedan, SUV, CrossOver, Hatchback, Minivan, Van)
 
This class diagram serves as a visual guide for understanding the relationships between the various components of the AutoCar application.
For a detailed explanation of each class and their respective properties and methods, refer to the code files in the repository.
