Since the 17th of Centuries, the legacy of transportation services has woven its way through history, connecting eras of innovation and convenience. Today, we proudly introduce Sutton Auto Wheels, a distinguished online taxi company at the intersection of time-honored tradition and cutting-edge technology. Just as horse-drawn carriages once traversed bustling streets in 17th-century Europe, we embark on a journey that harmonizes the past with the future.
Our roots trace back to when merchants, innkeepers, and elitists harnessed the power of taxis for their travels. The 17th-century hackney carriages of London set the stage, offering rides to pedestrians in densely populated areas. This early concept paved the way for the evolution of transportation, with regulations and licensing gradually shaping the landscape. From the introduction of the hansom cab in 1834, which revolutionized the speed and efficiency of city travel, to the present day, where artificial intelligence and self-driving cars are on the horizon, Sutton Auto Wheels has embraced each era's advancements.

With a history spanning centuries, we are not simply a taxi company but a testament to the resilience of an idea that has adapted and thrived. As we step into the future, we carry this legacy forward, leveraging state-of-the-art technology to enhance the riding experience for our passengers. Our commitment to excellence, safety, and efficiency remains unwavering as we strive to seamlessly blend the timeless elegance of the past with the limitless possibilities of the future. Welcome to Sutton Auto Wheels, where tradition meets innovation on the road ahead.
Now, we are proud to announce that we are the first company to use self-driving cars using artificial intelligence technology. In the following, you will get to know the essential parts of the company.
